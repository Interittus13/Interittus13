# Hello, Folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px" />

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Arpit Gupta, a **DevSecOps Engineer** 🛠 passionate about **building secure, scalable, and resilient software systems**. 🚀 I thrive on leveraging cutting-edge technologies to bridge the gap between development, security, and operations for seamless automation.  

🔐 **Security and automation** are my forte, and I ensure every system I touch is protected against modern threats. Whether it's deploying cloud-native architectures, designing robust CI/CD pipelines, or enforcing security best practices, I’m here to optimize and safeguard your workflows.  

💡 With a focus on **Azure DevOps** and **GitHub Actions**, I simplify complex processes like building, testing, and deploying software while ensuring **rapid delivery** without compromising quality. My pipelines are built to scale, secure, and adapt to evolving business needs.  

🛡️ **Security isn’t just a feature; it’s a responsibility.** From using **Azure Security Center** and **Key Vault** to conducting compliance audits, I specialize in securing cloud environments against vulnerabilities and threats while staying ahead of industry standards.  

🌟 Collaboration is at the heart of my work. I enjoy contributing to **open-source projects**, hosting tech workshops, and engaging with the developer community to share insights and learn together.
